#Insult-o-Matic

When my teacher told me to try APIs, I found this API that server insults, and I thought it was the funniest thing, so I uploaded it here. 

# Setup

Step 1. 

Download the script ```git clone https://github.com/Ejo2001/Insult-o-Matic.git```

Step 2.

Install Python and pip ```sudo apt install python3.9 python3-pip```  

Step 3.

Install Requests with pip ```pip install requests```  

Step 4. 

Run it ```python3 /path/to/script```

# OPTIONAL

Set it up as an alias so you can curse your friends on the fly in the terminal

Step 5.

```alias curse="python3 /path/to/script"```
